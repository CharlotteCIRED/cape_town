# Cape Town
NEDUM - Cape Town code. Adapted from Basile's code.
## Structure
Use main.py to define parameters and options, import the data and run a simulation. <br />
Parameters and options are defined in fold 'parameters_and_options'. <br />
The data import is in folder 'data'. <br />
The solver used to make the simulations and the associate functions computing the outputs are in the folder 'solver'. <br />
Outputs (maps/table) are produced in the folder 'plot_and_export_outputs'. <br />
## Flood data
Flood data are processed in the folder 'flood data'. <br />
Part of the code is an R (spatial data). <br />
Run descriptive_statistics.py to produce descriptive statistics on floods.
